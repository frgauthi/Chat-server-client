	-Create a seperate function that clears the message buffer
	
	-recover from errors such as accepting clients rather than crashing
	(not all clients will fail, server should not crash if one does)

	-Make it so the server can send back a message as a client can.

	-append an identification to each message

	-make a server function that relays messages it gets to other
	clients that are connected

	-modify the server to allow 2 clients to be connected simultaneously
	
	-temporarily allow the server to send messages to the client
	to allow for testing over the internet
